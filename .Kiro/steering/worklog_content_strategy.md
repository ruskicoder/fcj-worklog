# Worklog Content Strategy for AWS FCJ Program

## Overview

This document provides guidance for filling in worklog content for the AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) program internship. It defines how to create realistic, professional worklog entries based on actual user activities and typical AWS learning patterns.

## Content Sources Priority

### 1. Primary Sources (Actual User Data)
- **workdays.md**: Office attendance dates (9am-5pm workdays)
- **events.md**: AWS events, workshops, special occasions
- Use these as the foundation for all worklog entries

### 2. Secondary Sources (Fill Missing Gaps)
- Typical AWS Cloud Practitioner learning activities
- Revision periods from past learning topics
- Vague mentions of family occasions or external events

## Workday Classification

### Office Workdays (9am-5pm)
**Characteristics:**
- Heavier learning activities
- More detailed worklog entries
- Hands-on labs and practical exercises
- Deeper exploration of AWS services

**Content Pattern:**
```
- Morning: Study AWS service documentation
- Afternoon: Hands-on labs and practice
- Evening: Review and documentation
```

**Actual Workdays (2025) - Registration date +1 day:**
- 10/9, 15/9, 22/9, 23/9
- 6/10, 8/10, 30/10
- 10/11, 11/11
- 3/12

**Special Cases:**
- 29/10: Off due to heavy rain (registered 28/10, home day)
- 31/10: Midterm exam (registered 30/10, not office workday)

### Home Days
**Characteristics:**
- Lighter worklog entries
- Self-paced learning
- Documentation reading
- Review of previous topics
- May include day off for family occasions

**Content Pattern:**
```
- Light study sessions
- Documentation review
- Practice exercises
- OR: Day off for family/personal matters
```

### Weekend Days (Saturday/Sunday)
**Rule:** Exclude from worklog entirely
**Reason:** Reserved for family occasions and other personal events
**Exception:** Special AWS events scheduled on weekends

## Event Handling Priority

3. Doctor revisit #2 (5/12/2025)

**Content Approach:**

- Impact on learning activities
- Adaptations made to continue learning

### Priority 3: Team Workshop & Project (Override AWS Study)
**Timeline:** From 5/11/2025 onwards
**Content Shift:**

- Focus on team project work
- Team meetings and collaboration
- Project development activities

**Content Pattern:**
```
- Team meetings and planning

## Content Filling Strategy

### For Documented Weeks (with workdays/events)
1. Start with actual workday activities
2. Add event details if event occurred
3. Fill remaining days with appropriate learning activities
4. Balance between study and rest days

### For Undocumented Weeks (no specific data)
1. Use typical AWS learning progression
2. Include revision periods (review past topics)
3. Add 1-2 vague mentions of family/external events
4. Maintain realistic learning pace

**Example Undocumented Week Pattern:**
```
Monday: Study AWS service X
Tuesday: Hands-on lab for service X
Wednesday: Day off (family occasion)
Thursday: Review previous week's topics
Friday: Practice exercises and documentation
Saturday/Sunday: (Not included in worklog)
```

## Blog Translation Timeline

**Start:** Week 5 (early October)
**Pattern:** 1 blog per week approximately
**Total:** 6 blogs by end of program

**Content to Include:**
- Blog topic and original source

- Time spent on translation

## Professional Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Use professional, clear language
- Be specific about AWS services and features
- Include technical details where relevant
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Show learning progression

### Don't:
- Over-exaggerate activities
- Fabricate specific technical details without basis
- Include overly personal information
- Use informal language
- Make claims about mastery without evidence

## Bilingual Content Requirements

### English Version (_index.md)
- Professional technical English
- AWS service names in English
- Clear, concise descriptions

### Vietnamese Version (_index.vi.md)
- Professional Vietnamese
- Keep AWS service names in English (common practice)
- Translate descriptions and explanations
- Maintain same structure and information scope

## Content Balance

### Heavier Learning Days (Office Workdays)
- 3-5 specific activities
- Detailed descriptions
- Technical depth
- Hands-on practice mentioned

### Lighter Learning Days (Home Days)
- 1-2 activities
- Brief descriptions
- Review or reading focus
- OR: Simple mention of day off

### Event Days
- Full event coverage

- [ ] No Saturday/Sunday entries (unless special event)
- [ ] Both English and Vietnamese versions consistent
- [ ] Professional tone maintained throughout
- [ ] Hugo front matter correct (weight matches week number)
- [ ] Realistic learning progression shown

## Special Considerations

### Injury Period (14/11 onwards)
- Acknowledge injury professionally
- Show adaptation to limitations
- Continued learning despite challenges
- Focus on less hands-on activities (reading, planning)

### Team Project Period (5/11 onwards)
- Shift from individual AWS study to team work

- Still attend AWS events (Cloud Mastery Series)
- Balance project work with event participation

### Midterm Period (30/10)
