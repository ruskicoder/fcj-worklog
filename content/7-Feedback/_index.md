The speakers from AWS and industry partners shared practical insights that complemented the self-study materials effectively.

**3. Relevance to Academic Major & Career Goals**  
The program content aligns perfectly with modern cloud computing curriculum and industry demands. Learning AWS services hands-on, combined with technical blog translation, provided both technical depth and communication skills essential for cloud engineering roles. The team project component added valuable collaborative experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The program offered diverse learning opportunities: technical skills through AWS service exploration, documentation skills through worklog maintenance, translation skills through blog projects, and teamwork through the final project. Attending multiple AWS events (Cloud Day, Data Science Workshop, Cloud Mastery Series) provided exposure to current industry trends and networking opportunities.

**5. Community & Collaboration**  
The AWS FCJ community is supportive and collaborative. Events like the Kick-off session and Cloud Mastery Series created opportunities to connect with fellow learners, AWS professionals, and industry experts. The team project phase fostered strong collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
The most satisfying aspects were the hands-on experience with real AWS services and attending the AWS Cloud Mastery Series. Being able to deploy actual cloud infrastructure and see concepts from documentation come to life was incredibly rewarding. The networking opportunities at AWS events and connecting with industry professionals were also highlights.

**What do you think the program should improve for future participants?**  
Consider providing more structured guidance for the team project phase, perhaps with milestone checkpoints. Additional workshops on specific AWS certifications (like Cloud Practitioner or Solutions Architect Associate) would be valuable. More opportunities for peer collaboration and knowledge sharing throughout the program would enhance the learning experience.
