### Key Content Highlights

#### 1. AWS Foundation and Agentic AI

- **Opening**: Nguyễn Gia Hưng opens the event, emphasizing the increasingly critical role of **Agentic AI** in today's cloud technology landscape
- **Bedrock Agent Core**: Kiên Nguyễn provides technical overview of AWS Bedrock Agent Core, explaining how this service simplifies creating Agents capable of **planning** and **executing tasks** through API calls

#### 2. Real-World Applications

- **Building Agentic Workflows**: Việt Phạm demonstrates a specific use case, illustrating the design and deployment of an agentic workflow from start to finish on AWS platform
- **CloudThinker Introduction**: Thắng Tôn introduces CloudThinker ecosystem and the company's vision for AI-integrated cloud solutions

#### 3. Deep Dive (Level 300)

- **Agent Orchestration & Context Optimization**: This is the deep technical section of the morning. Henry Bùi discusses advanced strategies for **orchestrating multi-agent systems** and **context optimization** in Amazon Bedrock, ensuring high accuracy in complex interactions

#### 4. Hands-on Practice

- **CloudThinker Hack**: Facilitated by Kha Văn, this 60-minute hands-on session allows participants to directly apply learned knowledge to build an agent prototype using CloudThinker framework and AWS services

---

### Key Takeaways

#### Evolution of AI

- **From Chat to Action**: The technology field is witnessing a strong shift from chatbots that only respond passively to **proactive Agents** capable of performing complex orchestration and calling APIs to complete tasks
- **Context is Key**: As workflows become increasingly complex, standard context windows are insufficient. Applying **"Context Optimization"** strategies is essential for reducing operational costs while increasing Agent accuracy

#### Architecture

- **Orchestration Model**: Managing a system with multiple Agents requires a strong **Orchestration Layer** to allocate and decide which Agent handles which part of user requests

---

### Application to Work

- **Prototype Agent**: Use **AWS Bedrock Agent** to build simple internal tools capable of connecting to existing company APIs (for example: checking server status or leave statistics)
- **Research Context Models**: Deep dive into context optimization techniques shared by Henry Bùi to apply to current **RAG** systems for improved performance
- **Join Hackathons**: Encourage technical team to participate in similar real hackathons for the fastest and most intuitive updates on AWS new features

---

### Event Experience

The event was highly technical and deeply focused on a single topic.

- **Technical Depth**: The **L300 session** on Orchestration was particularly valuable, helping me understand how to scale AI applications beyond simple demos
- **Interactivity**: The **"CloudThinker Hack"** section helped me immediately reinforce theoretical knowledge with practice, making this one of the most effective learning sessions
