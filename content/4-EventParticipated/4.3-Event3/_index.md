# **Workshop: Data Science on AWS**

**Location**: FPT University HCM Campus

**Date**: Thursday, October 16, 2025

### Event Objectives

- Explore the entire journey of building a modern Data Science system, from theory to practice
- Master the **end-to-end Data Science workflow** on AWS, including storage, processing, and model deployment
- Gain practical experience with real datasets (IMDb) and applied models (Sentiment Analysis)
- Analyze trade-offs between **Cloud and On-premise** infrastructure in terms of cost and performance

### Key Content Highlights

#### 1. Role of Cloud in Data Science and Workflow Overview

- **Importance of Cloud**: Analyze why modern data science relies on cloud platforms to achieve scalability and high integration, rather than being limited by traditional on-premise infrastructure
- **Data Science Workflow on AWS**:
  - **Storage**: Use **Amazon S3** as the core data lake platform
  - **ETL/Processing**: Use **AWS Glue** for serverless data integration tasks
  - **Modeling**: Leverage **Amazon SageMaker** as the central hub for building, training, and deploying models
  - Overview of AWS's extensive AI/ML ecosystem, including AI services, ML services, and infrastructure

#### 2. Practical Demonstrations

- **Demo 1: Data Processing with AWS Glue**:
  - **Scenario**: Process and clean raw data from the IMDb dataset
  - **Technique**: Demonstrate effective feature engineering and data preparation methods. The workshop highlights different approaches, from low-code options like **SageMaker Canvas** to code-first methods using Numpy/Pandas
- **Demo 2: Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker**:
  - **Scenario**: Train and deploy a machine learning model for sentiment analysis from text data
  - **Process**: Illustrate the "Train, Tune, Deploy" cycle in **SageMaker Studio**. The session also covers the "Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)" concept, showcasing flexibility with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch

#### 3. Strategic Discussion

- **Cloud versus On-Premise**: In-depth discussion on cost optimization and performance metrics. Content highlights how cloud elasticity enables testing heavy workloads without large upfront hardware investment for on-premise infrastructure
- **Small Project Guide**: Introduction to a project designed after the workshop to reinforce learned skills

### What I Learned

#### Technical Workflow

- **Unified Workflow**: A powerful data science workflow extends beyond just code; it requires seamless integration between storage (S3), cleaning (Glue), and modeling (SageMaker)
- **Tool Selection**: Understanding when to use pre-managed services (like Amazon Comprehend or Textract) and when to build custom models on SageMaker is key to achieving efficiency

#### Industry Application

- **Real-world Context**: The transition from academic theory to industrial application lies in automation and scalability capabilities
- **Cost Awareness**: Successful data projects must balance model accuracy with associated computational costs

---

### Application to Work

- **Apply AWS Glue**: Propose converting local ETL scripts to AWS Glue for serverless data processing automation on larger datasets
- **Deploy SageMaker**: Migrate experimental models from local Jupyter notebooks to **SageMaker Studio** to standardize training and deployment workflows
- **Implement Project**: Execute the small project proposed after the workshop to solidify understanding of IMDb data processing workflow

---

### Event Experience

The workshop **"Data Science on AWS"** served as an important bridge between academic knowledge and business practice.

- **Direct Connection**: The event linked theoretical knowledge with technologies used by leading global enterprises
- **Practical Perspective**: Observing the process of cleaning the **IMDb dataset** and deploying a **Sentiment Analysis model** directly on the cloud simplified the complexity of AI on Cloud platforms
- **Expert Guidance**: Interacting with AWS Community Builders provided deep insights into the "Cloud versus On-premise" debate, helping me grasp the strategic value of cloud migration beyond technical features
