  * Set up route tables and Internet Gateway
  * Validated network connectivity and routing
  * Gained practical experience with VPC components

* **S3 Practical Skills**
  * Created and configured S3 buckets
  * Uploaded and managed objects successfully
  * Implemented bucket policies for access control
  * Practiced S3 operations through AWS Console
  * Understood S3 security best practices

* **RDS Database Experience**
  * Launched first RDS MySQL instance
  * Configured database security groups properly
  * Established database connectivity
  * Understood RDS backup and maintenance concepts
  * Learned database instance management

* **Serverless Computing Introduction**

### Challenges Faced

* VPC lab required careful attention to subnet CIDR blocks and routing configuration
* RDS security group configuration needed multiple attempts to get connectivity working
* Translating technical AWS terminology while maintaining accuracy and clarity
* Balancing hands-on lab time with theoretical learning

### Key Learnings

* Hands-on practice is essential for solidifying theoretical VPC knowledge
* Proper security group configuration is critical for RDS connectivity
* Serverless computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional infrastructure
* Technical translation requires deep understanding of both source and target concepts
* AWS services integrate seamlessly when properly configured

### Next Week Goals
