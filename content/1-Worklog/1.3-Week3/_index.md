### Week 3 Achievements:

* **VPC Fundamentals:**
  * Understood VPC architecture and core concepts
  * Successfully configured VPC instances
  * Learned VPC networking and security group configurations
  * Practiced VPC integration with other AWS services

* **EC2 Service Mastery:**
  * Gained hands-on experience with EC2 instance deployment
  * Explored EC2 instance types and configurations
  * Learned EC2 connection methods and management
  * Understood EC2 integration with VPC

* **Static Website Deployment:**
  * Successfully deployed a static website using S3
  * Configured S3 bucket for website hosting
  * Integrated S3 with EC2 for server hosting
  * Tested website functionality and accessibility

* **AWS Architecture Diagramming:**
  * Learned to use draw.io for AWS architecture diagrams
  * Practiced creating professional AWS infrastructure diagrams
  * Documented VPC and EC2 configurations visually

* **Cost Optimization:**
  * Discovered AWS cost management strategies
  * Learned methods to reduce AWS service costs
  * Understood billing and cost monitoring tools

* **Version Control and AI Tools:**
  * Explored Git version control practices
  * Gained experience with Kiro AI capabilities and limitations
  * Learned the importance of clear requirements for AI-assisted development

### Challenges Faced:

* **Kiro AI Implementation Issues:**
  * Encountered significant code corruption and hallucination problems when using Kiro AI
  * Spent 2-3 days debugging corrupted code
  * Root cause: Unclear and insufficiently detailed requirements allowed AI to make incorrect assumptions
  * Lesson learned: AI tools require precise, well-defined requirements to produce reliable code
  * Decision made: Deleted corrupted repository and restarted with clearer approach

* **Requirement Specification:**
  * Learned that detailed requirements are critical for successful AI-assisted development
  * Understood the gap between general instructions and specific implementation needs
  * Improved ability to write clear, actionable requirements

### Key Learnings:

* EC2 provides flexible compute capacity with various instance types and configurations
* S3 can effectively host static websites with proper configuration
* Integration between VPC, EC2, and S3 enables robust application architectures
* Cost optimization is crucial for sustainable AWS usage
* Clear, detailed requirements are essential for successful AI-assisted development
* Version control practices help manage code changes and experimentation

### Next Week Goals:

* Continue exploring AWS services and their integrations
* Apply lessons learned about requirement specification
* Practice more complex AWS architecture patterns
* Improve cost optimization strategies
