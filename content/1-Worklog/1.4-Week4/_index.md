### Week 4 Achievements

* **VPC Networking Mastery**
  * Understood VPC architecture and components
  * Learned the difference between public and private subnets
  * Grasped routing concepts with route tables
  * Understood how Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway work

* **Amazon S3 Proficiency**
  * Learned S3 storage concepts and use cases
  * Understood different S3 storage classes (Standard, IA, Glacier)
  * Practiced bucket creation and object management
  * Configured bucket policies and access controls
  * Explored S3 versioning and lifecycle management
  * Learned about S3 encryption options (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)

* **Database Services Introduction**
  * Gained overview of AWS RDS service
  * Understood different database engine options (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  * Learned about RDS instance sizing and configuration
  * Explored backup and restore capabilities

* **Practical Skills Development**
  * Improved understanding of AWS networking architecture
  * Enhanced ability to navigate AWS documentation effectively
  * Prepared for hands-on labs in upcoming week

### Challenges Faced

* VPC routing concepts initially seemed complex, especially understanding the relationship between route tables, subnets, and gateways
* S3 bucket policies and IAM permissions required careful attention to avoid access issues
* Balancing theoretical learning with practical hands-on time

### Key Learnings

* VPC is fundamental to AWS networking and security architecture
* S3 is incredibly versatile beyond simple storage - can host static websites, serve as data lake, etc.
* Proper subnet design (public vs private) is crucial for security best practices
* AWS documentation is comprehensive but requires time to digest thoroughly

### Next Week Goals

* Continue with AWS database services (RDS hands-on)
* Start blog translation work (first AWS technical blog)
* Explore AWS Lambda and serverless concepts
* Deepen understanding of IAM roles and policies
