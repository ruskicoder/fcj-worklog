During my internship with the **AWS First Cloud Journey Program** from **September 2025** to **December 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply cloud computing knowledge in a structured learning environment focused on AWS services and technologies.

I participated in **comprehensive AWS cloud learning activities**, including hands-on labs with core AWS services (EC2, S3, VPC, RDS, Lambda), attended multiple AWS events and workshops, translated technical AWS blogs from English to Vietnamese, and collaborated on a team project implementing cloud solutions. Through these activities, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture, technical documentation, translation, problem-solving, and teamwork**.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently completed weekly learning objectives, maintained detailed worklogs, actively participated in AWS community events, and collaborated effectively with team members on the final project.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
